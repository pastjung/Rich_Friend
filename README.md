A calculator that calculates desired assets and required assets at retirement based on the user's assets and investment method

## Getting Started

If you register your personal assets, you can use the 'Retirement Calculator' to check the assets you need until retirement and check the process of your assets growing.

If you only want approximate information, you can use the 'Wealth Calculator' without registering assets to find out the assets needed for retirement and the approximate process of increasing assets.
